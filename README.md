## Project Description
This project converts a static landing page into a dynamic one using JavaScript.

Using the skills acquired from the Professional Web Development Udacity track, a dynamic and responsive navigation bar was built from the existing sections in the HTML page, and styled using CSS.

The navigation bar has clickable elements that scroll to the clicked section. 

The viewed section has a "your-active-class" class that is updated according to the viewport.
